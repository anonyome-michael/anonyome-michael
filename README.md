ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anonyome-michael. I work for Anonyome Labs and when not working am either baking, playing guitar, or being a hobby magician.

My specialty is iOS, and my focus is now in the Architecture/Technical lead position. I'm currently learning `swift-vapor` and `elixir` for funsies.

I am always looking for things to work on, and currently am very interested in tooling and source code editor extensions for xcode.
